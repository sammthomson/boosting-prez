# Quick Intro to Boosting

This is a 30 minute presentation I gave to
[our NLP research group](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/) on gradient boosting.

It uses [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) for the slides. You should be able to just
clone the repo and open the `GradientBoosting.html` file in a browser.
